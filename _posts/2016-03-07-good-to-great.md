Good To Great

Going from a bad situation to a good situation makes sense to people. The bad is chasing you towards the good. There's purpose and reason to try, to struggle and to do things that will help you get from one to the other. The impetus is obvious - get out of pain.

Going from good to great? Not quite as obvious or as urgent. Good is simply that - good. Why change that? Why shake up the status quo when you're good?

If you're happy without great, there's nothing chasing you there urgently.

So people dream of writing the book, but they are also good without it.

Writing a book takes effort and time and it's uncomfortable. It brings up fears and points out inadequacies. It's a vulnerable process and it demands that you step up into your power and deliver something that is a statement of who you are in the world.

It's a step towards GREAT.

So it's easier to stay in the GOOD.

It's easier to dream about writing rather than get uncomfortable  
It's safer.  
It's not urgent.

Growing from good to great takes more than just dreaming. It's when the want turns into a need.

So read this and stay 'good'. That's fine.

But if you're willing to get uncomfortable and stretch, then you're ready to start writing the damn book.

Going from Good to Great may not seem urgent, but I promise you that the discomfort is so worth it on the other side.
